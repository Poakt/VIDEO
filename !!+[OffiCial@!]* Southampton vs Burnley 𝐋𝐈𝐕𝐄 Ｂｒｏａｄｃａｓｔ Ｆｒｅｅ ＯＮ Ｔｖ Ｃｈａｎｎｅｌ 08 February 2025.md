Scott Parker's Clarets pose a difficult test for a struggling Southampton having conceded just once across their last 10 games.

Follow live coverage as Southampton face Burnley in the FA Cup today.

This season marks the 144th edition of the world‚Äôs oldest cup competition, with Manchester United the reigning champions after they beat local rivals Manchester City in the final at Wembley.

While the usual suspects are likely to be in the running this season - Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham all included as well as the aforementioned Manchester duo - it‚Äôs those without silverware in recent years who will hope to challenge into the latter stages, such as Newcastle United, Everton and even Chelsea, who are without a domestic trophy in over six years despite European success.

Premier League clubs enter from the third round of the competition, but every team takes part: from non-league to EFL sides in the lower leagues, everyone gets a shot at glory and the chance to face the country‚Äôs finest in the FA Cup.

Southampton vs Burnley Preview
After claiming just their second Premier League victory of the season last weekend, will Southampton continue to make headway in the FA Cup?

A week ago, the Saints support had a very rare victory to celebrate, as their side beat Ipswich 2-1 at Portman Road. Joe Aribo broke the deadlock on the volley, before Paul Onuachu bundled home the last-gasp winner.

Before this, Ivan Juriƒá had lost all six league matches in charge. The victory at the weekend took Southampton's points tally to nine, yet still a humungous ten points from safety. So, why not see how far they can go in the FA Cup?

In round three, the Saints swatted aside Swansea 3-0 at St Mary's, with Kamaldeen Sulemana opening the scoring before Tyler Dibling bagged a brace. However, they might not find goals quite as easy to come by in this round.

That's because Burnley travel to the South Coast boasting the meanest defence in the country, possibly on course to end the campaign with the best defence in English football history.

So far, the Clarets have conceded just nine goals in 31 EFL Championship matches, although they've only scored 37 times up the other end.

This is why ten of their matches have produced goalless draws, including last Saturday's clash with Portsmouth at Fratton Park, just 19 miles across the South Coast.

On Tuesday night, Scott Parker's side did beat Oxford United 1-0 at Turf Moor, meaning they are second in the table, five points adrift of Leeds. It is 820 minutes since they last conceded a league goal.

In FA Cup terms, Burnley overcame Reading 3-1 after extra time in round three, Zian Flemming scoring twice during the additional half-hour, so can the Clarets reach round five for just the fourth time in 14 seasons?
