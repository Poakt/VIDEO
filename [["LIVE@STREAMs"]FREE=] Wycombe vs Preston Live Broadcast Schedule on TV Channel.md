Preston v Wycombe stats and head-to-head record (H2H)
Preston and Wycombe last met in the 2020/21 season when both sides were in the Championship.

Wycombe are unbeaten in their last three matches against Preston.

The last FA Cup meeting came in the third round during the 2020/21 season, when Wycombe recorded a 4-1 home win.

This season marks the 144th edition of the world’s oldest cup competition, with Manchester United the reigning champions after they beat local rivals Manchester City in the final at Wembley.

While the usual suspects are likely to be in the running this season - Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham all included as well as the aforementioned Manchester duo - it’s those without silverware in recent years who will hope to challenge into the latter stages, such as Newcastle United, Everton and even Chelsea, who are without a domestic trophy in over six years despite European success.

Premier League clubs enter from the third round of the competition, but every team takes part: from non-league to EFL sides in the lower leagues, everyone gets a shot at glory and the chance to face the country’s finest in the FA Cup.
