Follow live coverage as Wigan Athletic face Fulham in the FA Cup today.

This season marks the 144th edition of the world’s oldest cup competition, with Manchester United the reigning champions after they beat local rivals Manchester City in the final at Wembley.

While the usual suspects are likely to be in the running this season - Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham all included as well as the aforementioned Manchester duo - it’s those without silverware in recent years who will hope to challenge into the latter stages, such as Newcastle United, Everton and even Chelsea, who are without a domestic trophy in over six years despite European success.

Premier League clubs enter from the third round of the competition, but every team takes part: from non-league to EFL sides in the lower leagues, everyone gets a shot at glory and the chance to face the country’s finest in the FA Cup.

Fulham manager Marco Silva has analysed what he expects from the upcoming clash and Willian's return to the squad
"The reception and the way everyone has welcomed him again speaks volumes about himself. He’s a top professional, not just on the pitch but off the pitch as well. Of course, the main thing is to have good players who can help the team win games, but at the same time, you need to have the right characters in the dressing room as well. He comes into training every day with a smile on his face. As a footballer, he fits really well with the way we want to play. It’s probably going to take him two or three weeks to be in the best shape he can be, because he’s not played in the last month and a half. He wanted to come back to Fulham. I have a great relationship with him from a personal point of view. He was an important player in the last two seasons and he helped the club achieve important things. Let’s hope in 15/20 days we can have him back at his best level and he can embrace the challenge ahead of him. I had Shaun at a different age to what I had Tom. He was older in that moment. He always had an eye on everything we were doing, I always had chats with him and most of the time, at the end of the sessions, he would ask questions. He was interested in everything. It was in his mind to try and get the chance to be a coach and it was clear to me that if he was going to get the chance, he was going [to take it]. He was a top professional, a lovely guy and I’ve been in contact with him. Even when he was assistant to [Roberto] Martinez at Belgium, we met sometimes, and we met in England as well. It will be really good to see him before and after the match.”
